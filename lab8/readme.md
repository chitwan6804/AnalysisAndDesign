## Program 3: 0/1 Knapsack using merge purge:

__Aim:__

0/1 Knapsack using merge purge.

__Algorithm:__

The provided algorithm employs dynamic programming to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem efficiently. It iterates through each item, constructing sets of pairs representing all possible combinations of accumulated values and weights up to the current item. These sets are merged and pruned to eliminate dominated solutions, ensuring only non-dominated solutions are considered. The algorithm then finds the maximum value among the remaining solutions and identifies the corresponding items contributing to it.

__Time Complexity:__

Time-complexity is O (2^n), where n is the number of items.
