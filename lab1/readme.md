**Problem 1: Permutation Generator:-**
This program generates all permutations of a given set of numbers or characters.

Recurrance tree and its pseudocode that is to be followed in order to create solution for this problem is as follows:

_Time Complexity_
The time complexity of the permutations generator is O(n!), where n is the number of elements in the set. This is because there are n! (n factorial) possible permutations to generate.
