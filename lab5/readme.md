# Problem 1: Prim's Algorithm

The provided C++ implementation offers a solution to find the MST using Prim's Algorithm. It selects the minimum-weight edge at each step to grow the spanning tree until all vertices are included, ensuring a connected and acyclic tree.Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that efficiently finds the minimum-weight spanning tree for a connected, undirected graph.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(V^2) with an adjacency matrix representation and O((V + E) log V) with an adjacency list representation, where "V" is the number of vertices and "E" is the number of edges.
