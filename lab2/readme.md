# Problem 1: Power of Number Calculator

The Power of Number Calculator is a program that calculates the power of a given number using two different methods: iterative and recursive (divide and conquer) techniques. It compares the execution time of both methods for a range of input values.
The program calculates the power of a given number using both iterative and recursive methods. It then measures the execution time for each method and writes the data to a file.

**Time complexity**

_Iterative Method:_
The iterative method calculates the power of a number by performing a loop a specified number of times. In this case, the loop runs i times, where i is the exponent. Therefore, the time complexity of the iterative method is O(i), where i is the exponent.

_Recursive (Divide and Conquer) Method:_
The recursive method uses a divide and conquer approach to calculate the power of a number. It splits the problem into subproblems of smaller size and combines the results. In this case, the function is recursively called log(i) times, where i is the exponent. This is because the exponent is divided by 2 at each recursive call until it reaches 0. Therefore, the time complexity of the recursive method is O(log(i)), where i is the exponent.
