# Problem 1: Power of Number Calculator

The Power of Number Calculator is a program that calculates the power of a given number using two different methods: iterative and recursive (divide and conquer) techniques. It compares the execution time of both methods for a range of input values.
The program calculates the power of a given number using both iterative and recursive methods. It then measures the execution time for each method and writes the data to a file.
